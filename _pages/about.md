Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by.

I'm a third-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science. Alongside my studies, I co-founded Admittere, an AI-powered college admissions platform, and RealStudio.ai, a generative design startup. Both ventures gave me hands-on experience building full-stack systems, scaling AI applications, and leading teams from idea to execution.

On the research side, I work at Berkeley's Sky Lab, focusing on multi-agent AI systems. My recent projects include building reasoning traces for Gorilla LLM's multi-turn function calling, creating datasets to stress-test multimodal prompts where state-of-the-art models fail, and working on the inference to test LLM's ability to perform complex function calls. I'm also exploring memory management for large ML systems, specifically policies to optimize KV-cache hit rates - an area I hope to pursue further in graduate research.

I currently serve on the course staff for CS 161 (Computer Security), where I love helping students master complex systems concepts. Teaching keeps me grounded and sharpens the way I approach problems.

Outside of academics, you'll usually find me playing soccer (the best sport out there), boxing, doing MMA, hiking, or enjoying a great cup of coffee.

If our interests overlap or you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out!
